    "# Miniproject: Landing on the Moon\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, reinforcement learning has operated on \"tabular\" state spaces, e.g. \"State 1\", \"State 2\", \"State 3\" etc. However, many important and interesting reinforcement learning problems (like moving robot arms or playing Atari games) are based on either continuous or very high-dimensional state spaces (like robot joint angles or pixels). Deep neural networks constitute one method for learning a value function or policy from continuous and high-dimensional observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this miniproject, you will teach an agent to play the Lunar Lander game from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/). The agent needs to learn how to land a lunar module safely on the surface of the moon. The state space is 8-dimensional and (mostly) continuous, consisting of the X and Y coordinates, the X and Y velocity, the angle, and the angular velocity of the lander, and two booleans indicating whether the left and right leg of the lander have landed on the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent gets a reward of +100 for landing safely and -100 for crashing. In addition, it receives \"shaping\" rewards at every step. It receives positive rewards for moving closer to [0,0], decreasing in velocity, shifting to an upright angle and touching the lander legs on the moon. It receives negative rewards for moving away from the landing site, increasing in velocity, turning sideways, taking the lander legs off the moon and for using fuel (firing the thrusters). The best score an agent can achieve in an episode is about +250.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of the task: one with discrete controls and one with continuous controls but we'll only work with the discrete version. In the discrete version, the agent can take one of four actions at each time step: [do nothing, fire engines left, fire engines right, fire engines down]. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Policy Gradient approaches (using the REINFORCE rule) to learn the task. As you remember, in standard supervised learning tasks (e.g. image classification), the network generates a probability distribution over the outputs, and is trained to maximize the probability of a specific target output given an observation (input). In Policy Gradient methods, the network generates a probability distribution over actions, and is trained to maximize expected future rewards given an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "**Question 1**. Suppose that you are designing the environment rewards yourself. Why do you think it is a good idea to have rewards in addition to the +100 reward for safe landing (e.g. for moving closer / further from [0, 0], for touching the lander legs on the moon)? One might say that if we only have a final reward, the agent will still be able to learn how to reach it. What will be the problem here?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**. Now suppose you decide to give the agent a small reward if it moves closer to the landing point but you forget to penalize it when it moves away from it. What kinds of strange behaviour you may observe from the trained agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - conda create -n cs456env python=3.7.2\n",
    "  - source activate cs456env\n",
    "  - pip install gym[Box2D]\n",
    "  - pip install ipykernel\n",
    "  - pip install tensorflow\n",
    "  - pip install keras\n",
    "  - pip install matplotlib\n",
    "  \n",
    "- You should know the concepts of \"policy\", \"policy gradient\", \"REINFORCE\", \"REINFORCE with baseline\". If you want to start and haven't seen these yet in class, read Sutton & Barto (2018) Chapter 13 (13.1-13.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will learn how to implement a policy gradient neural network using the REINFORCE algorithm.\n",
    "- You will learn how to implement baselines, including a learned value network.\n",
    "- You will learn how to analyze the performance of an RL algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning is noisy! Normally one should average over multiple random seeds with the same parameters to really see the impact of a change to the model, but we won't do this due to time constraints. However, you should be able to see learning over time with every approach. If you don't see any improvement, or very unstable learning, double-check your model and try adjusting the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may sometimes see `AssertionError: IsLocked() = False` after restarting your code. To fix this, reinitialize the environments by running the Gym Setup code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will not be marked on the episode movies. Please delete these movies before uploading your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The miniproject is marked out of 18, with a further mark breakdown in each question:\n",
    "- Exercise 1: 7 points\n",
    "- Exercise 2: 3 points\n",
    "- Exercise 3: 3 points\n",
    "- Exercise 4: 5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "We may perform random tests of your code but will not rerun the whole notebook."

    "\n",
    "1. Implement the `observe` method of the RLAgent above.\n",
    "2. Implement the `_build_network` method. Your network should take the 8-dimensional state space as input and output a softmax distribution over the 4 discrete actions. It should have 3 hidden layers with 16 units each with ReLU activations. Use the REINFORCE loss function. HINT: Keras has a built-in \"categorical cross-entropy\" loss, and a `sample_weight` argument in fit/train_on_batch. Consider how these could be used together.\n",
    "3. Implement the `decide`, `train` and `_get_returns` methods using the inputs and outputs of your network. In `train`, implement a baseline based on a moving average (over episodes) of the mean returns (over trials of one episode); it should only be in effect when the agent is constructed with the `use_simple_baseline` keyword. Also, use `train_on_batch` to form one minibatch from all the experiences in an episode. Hint: see Question 2) below.\n",

This can introduce instability in learning that needs to be addressed with more advanced techniques, so we won't use it for this miniproject.
